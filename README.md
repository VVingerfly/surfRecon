# surfRecon

Surface reconstruction from truncated signed distance function (TSDF).

Implementations of Marching Cubes and Extended Marching Cubes algorithms.
The code is modified and simplified from the original implementaion [IsoEx](https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/IsoEx/).

The code was developed under VS2015. And It depends on OpenMesh and Eigen.


## Todo
- add Dual Marching Cubes algorithm.
